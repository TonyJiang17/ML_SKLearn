# Machine Learning Part 1 

Overview: 
Here are some mini ML projects using sklearn closest neighbor (KNN) model to predict. 

Specific Files:
1. iris.py
In this project, the dataset include different types of irises by specific 
features such as, "sepal width, petal length, etc". Using the KNN Model, I tried to determine the 
type of the irises of the test group. 
(sub-file: iris.csv)

2. digits.py 
Digits.py uses pixals of handwritten numbers to determine what pixal patterns represent what number. Similar to iris.py, I used the KNN model. 
(sub-file: digits.csv)

3. titanic.py 
This file uses the famous titanic datasets, which includes information of all passenger aboard the ship.
By training the dataset using KNN model, I was able to predict with around 80% accuracy whether a specific passenger had 
survived the shipwreck or not.

Final Thoughts:
KNN is quite useful and it's very good at predicting dataset with features with the same units.
